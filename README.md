Project Overview  
The Product Sales Data Analysis project involved:  

Connecting to SQL Server: Using T-SQL to create data views and fact tables that served as the foundation for the analysis.
Data Transformation and Cleansing: Leveraging Power Query to prepare the data for analysis, including custom transformations to ensure data quality.
Date Dimension Creation: Utilizing DAX in Power BI to develop custom date dimensions, which were crucial for time-based analysis.
Data Modeling: Integrating multiple data sources into a cohesive data model that supports advanced analysis.
Data Visualization: Designing and implementing various Power BI visuals to effectively represent data insights, making it easier to identify trends and performance metrics.
Technologies Used
SQL Server: For database management, T-SQL queries, and creation of data views and fact tables.
Power BI: For data visualization, dashboard creation, and reporting.
Power Query: For data transformation, cleansing, and shaping within Power BI.
DAX (Data Analysis Expressions): For creating custom calculations, date dimensions, and advanced metrics.
Data Sources
SQL Server Database: The primary source of data, containing tables related to product sales, customers, orders, and more.
External Files (Optional): Additional data from Excel or CSV files integrated into the Power BI model.
Data Modeling
The data model includes:

Fact Tables: Central tables containing quantitative data, such as sales transactions and order details.
Dimension Tables: Supporting tables for descriptive attributes, including products, customers, salespersons, and date dimensions.
Star Schema: Implemented to optimize query performance and simplify report creation.
Dashboards & Visualizations
The project features several key dashboards, including:
